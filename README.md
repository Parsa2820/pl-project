Sharif University of Technology - Design of Programming Languages Course Project - Spring 2021 

This is a subset of the Python programming language implemented in Racket. The main difference is `;` which should be used instead of indentation for scopping and to seperate statements.

## Usage

Run files in DrRacket. Generally you can run a code using these 2 ways.

- Pass program text to the `main` function in the `main` module.
- Pass a file path which contains program text to the `evaluate-file` function in the `interpreter` module.

Written on DrRacket and Racket version 8.0.
