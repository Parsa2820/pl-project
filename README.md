Sharif University of Technology - Design of Programming Languages Course Project - Spring 2021 

This language is a subset of the Python programming language implemented in Racket. The main difference is `;` which should be used instead of indentation for scoping and to separate statements.

## Usage

Run files in DrRacket. Generally you can run a code using these 2 ways.

- Pass program text to the `main` function in the `main` module.
- Pass a file path which contains program text to the `main-file` function in the `main` module.

Written on DrRacket and Racket version 8.0.
